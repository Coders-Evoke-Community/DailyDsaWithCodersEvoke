# Here is your questions for Day 19

1. Write a method to check if a node exists in a binary tree or not. If the node exists then return true otherwise return false. <br>
 Example <br>
1 <br>
/ \ <br>
2 3 , findNode(5) ==> true, findNode(10) == false <br>
/ \ / \ <br>
4 5 6 7  <br> <br>

2. Write a program to find the Nth number in the Fibonacci series. <br>
   Example: Fibonacci series starts with double 1 and where next number is sum of previous two number, like 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 <br>
   
   fibonacci(2) = 1 <br>
   fibonacci(4) = 3 <br>
   fibonacci(5) = 3 <br> <br>
   
3. Given a binary tree, Write a method findMaxSumLevel to return the level that has the maximum sum. In case the tree is empty return -1. This problem is also known as Find Max Sum Level Problem. <br>

Example <br>
0 1 <br>
/ \ <br>
1 2 3 ==> 2 <br>
/ \ / \ <br>
2 4 5 6 7 <br>
